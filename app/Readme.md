# Application

Application based on C++ with help of QT/OpenCV libraries.

## Building:

1) You need to have QT installed on your machine
2) You need to place content of opencv build into `opencv` folder. `opencv` should have folders `bin`, `include` and etc

## Deeplab

Application depends on deeplab model. To use it download pretrained model from http://download.tensorflow.org/models/deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug_2018_01_04.tar.gz and place to "python/deeplab_model" folder with name "model.gz". **DONT EXTRACT IT BY YOURSELF**
